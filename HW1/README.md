# Homework 1
20 simple tasks to learn python.
It is required to write Python code that performs the task and evaluate the complexity of the algorithm O(N).

List of tasks:
1. Create a tuple containing 4 different numbers. Display the value of the second element of the tuple.
2. Write a program that accepts a string from the user and outputs the number of characters in that string.
3. Create a dictionary containing information about the student: name, age, course. Display all information about the student on the screen.
4. Using a loop, create a list containing all integers from 1 to 10 and display it on the screen.
5. Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns their sum.
6. Create a set of 5 different numbers, then add a new number to it and display it on the screen.
7. Write a program that accepts an integer from the user and displays its square on the screen.
8. Create a dictionary with five key-value pairs, where the keys are the names of fruits and the values are their colors. Output the values of all keys.
9. Write a function that accepts a string and outputs it in reverse order.
10. Create a list of 5 lines and replace the third element with a new line.
11. Create a tuple of 6 elements of different data types and display the type of each element.
12. Write a program that accepts two numbers from the user and outputs their product.
13. Create a dictionary containing information about the book (author, title, year of publication), and display this information on the screen.
14. Create a set containing the names of 5 different cities, then delete one name and display the remaining ones.
15. Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the maximum of them.
16. Create a list of numbers from 1 to 20, and then create a new list containing only the even numbers from the first list.
17. Write a program that accepts a string from the user and outputs True if the string is a palindrome, and False otherwise.
18. Create a tuple containing 3 elements of different data types and decompress it into separate variables.
19. Write a function that accepts a dictionary with information about a student (name, age, course) and outputs this information in formatted form.
20. Create a list and add 5 different items to it. Display the contents of the list on the screen.
